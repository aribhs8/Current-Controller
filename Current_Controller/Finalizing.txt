To-Do

I need to move the circuit schematic from Altium Designer to OrCAD, but before moving the schematic, let's add some more details to the Altium Designer circuit.

[*] 1) Move pushbutton from MCU to User I/F
[*] 2) Using Tracer schematic as reference, add net labels to wires.
[] 3) Create BOM and add N-Channel MOSFETs and P-Channel MOSFETs.
[] 4) Check FETs using Proteus and then create new schematic sheet for RESISTORS.SchDoc
